# Critical Mass React Project

> Use npm install and npm start


## Hi, this is a React take-home project for Critical mass. As per the instructions, video and JSON file, I have created a navigation bar, using Reactjs.

###### The same project has also been done in vanilla js. Link for the same : https://github.com/rajhanspol/Critical-Mass-Takehome-Project
